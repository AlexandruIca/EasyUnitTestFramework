# EasyUnitTestFramework
An easy to use unit testing framework for C++0x.
It's a very flexible framework, easy to setup and shouldn't increase compile times by too much.
# Setup
This framework uses CMake as its buildsystem. To link your project with this library should be fairly simple: clone this repository in your working directory and add the CMakeLists.txt (check usage/CMakeLists.txt).
If you don't use cmake it still shouldn't be too complicated, the framework only consists of one .cpp and one .hpp file.

Mocking?
Add CONTRIBUTING and CODE_OF_CONDUCT
Add .editorconfig
Add xml output capability(and json)
Port it to C to make it available to many more compilers(make it as close as possible to the c++ version)
Bright red text for fatal errors, darker red for failures, blue for warnings, yellow for messages and green text for no failures?
Add many more clear examples 
Remove test suites, since having infinitely nested sections available makes it confusing(this framework is made to be easy to use,
it will also help transitioning to C)

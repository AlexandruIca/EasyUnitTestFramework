# Mocking?
Something similar to google mock but using c++11 features. It would need to be very easy to use the mocking features with other unit testing frameworks.
# Add other output capabilities
Currently targeted: xml, json, toml, yaml, html. Enabled with command line options(eg. ```--eutf_output=xml```).
# Color in tests
For console output show text with some colors(eg. blue for messages, yellow for warnings, red for errors, green for successful tests).
# Add many more examples 
# Remove test suites
# Add timing option 
# Add running tests in parallel option
# Add run tests with certain tags option
